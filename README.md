# Object-Detection-using-Tensorflow
Developed an animal face detection system using TensorFlow with 85% accuracy. Utilized a pre-trained SSD MobileNet model fine-tuned on a custom animal face dataset. The model detects and classifies different animal faces in real time using webcam or image input. Applications include wildlife monitoring, zoo management, and animal behavior research.
